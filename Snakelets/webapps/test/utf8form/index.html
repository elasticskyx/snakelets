<h1>UTF-8 Form tester</h1>
<p>Often things go wrong when you're using Euro symbols (&euro;) or other
non-ASCII symbols in a Form, and then post the form to the web server.
<p>This web app shows how difficult it is to get it 100% right.
<p>Fact is that you also need to do some work on the <em>server</em>,
you have to force the request parameters to be UTF-8 encoded,
before you're parsing the form....
<p>
<br>
There are two different form test pages:
<ul>
<li><a href="defaultform.html">form with default page encoding</a>
<li><a href="utf8pageform.html">form with page=UTF-8</a>
</ul>
<p>(you'll discover that it doesn't matter in what encoding the <em>page</em> is, try it!)
