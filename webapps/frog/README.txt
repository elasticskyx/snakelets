Frog - Python web log ('blogging') system.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
Copy the 'frog' webapp to the webapps folder of your Snakelets 
installation. Edit the webapp's init file to change the required
configuration parameters (they're self explanatory).
Start Snakelets, and open the index page in your browser :)
(http://server:port/frog/)

File Manager:
-------------
You may want to use 'filemgr' (my web based file manager) to manage
the files in your account using your browser. You'll have to install
filemgr separately. BTW: Frog links to it from the menu by default.
Frog implements shared authentication for filemgr, so you don't have
to duplicate Frog's user accounts in filemger (if you have the 
SharedAuth plugin).
